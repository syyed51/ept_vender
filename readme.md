# Boilerplate project

Only must have tooling for react and understand everything present. Idea is to have a react only project so:

1. No Redux
1. No Rx
1. No Redux-observables
1. No FP

To do things in this repo are tooling for react project

1. Webpack
1. babel
1. react

If you wish to experiment, make a clone of this repo and work on it.

## Problems

1. webpack-html-plugin is not working.
1. eslint auto formatting not working.
